Hi I'm Mytchall, a full-stack developer living in New Zealand.

I have experience with developing custom themes for popular CMS platforms, building custom web apps and mobile games, with an earlier history in video editing and photojournalism.

Technology and creative media is my passion and I enjoy staying up-to-date with modern trends and currently work on Blockchain dApps and Smart Contracts.
